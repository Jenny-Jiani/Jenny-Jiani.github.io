# Statistics page

Usage statistics are summarized per Handshake Code and per License Item. By default, the usage for each Handshake Code is displayed.

![Statistics Page]({{site.assets}}imgs/statistics-001.png)

On the top of the page, you see the Handshake Code and all License Items configured to this Handshake Code. You can click on each of the License Items to get to the statistics page for that specific Item. Below that on the left, you can see 3 pie charts showing the usage of "All History", "The selected period" and "Today".

On the right, there is a line chart showing the trend of the usage and a table of numbers showing the detailed usage (per two hours).

> NOTE
>  
> * A License Item may be configured to multiple Handshake Codes, only the usage associated with the current Handshake Code is counted.
> * The usage of all License Items will be counted together as long as the usage is associated with the current Handshake Code.
