# Usage Alerts

The License Tracking Server checks the usage data every 10 minutes and if one of the following conditions is met, a notification email will be triggered.

> If multiple conditions are met, the email will contain all the information.

## Dynamsoft Barcode Reader

### Per Barcode Scan/Per Device  

Notification emails are triggered when the ratio of consumed to total quota reaches the following targets: 

> The usage is based on a single License Item

* 75%
* 90%
* 95%
* 100%: Normal quota is used up, entering the tolerance stage.
* 105% (Per Barcode Scan) or 110% (Per Device): Tolerance used up, the License Item is deactivated.

### Concurrent Device

When the ratio of failed authorization requests to the total number of requests reaches the following targets over the last 60 minutes of app activity:

> The usage is based on single Handshake Code

* 10%
* 25%
* 50%
* 75%

> NOTE
>  
> If the condition continues to be true, yet the ratio is not passing the next level (let's take the jump from 10% to 25%), no new email will be triggered. For example
> * 12:40 Failure rate: 8%
> * 12:50 Failure rate:13%, first email triggered
> * 13:00 Failure rate:17%
> * 13:10 Failure rate:14%
> * 13:20 Failure rate:30%, second email triggered
> * 13:30 Failure rate:40%
> * 13:40 Failure rate:44%
> * 13:50 Failure rate:42%
> * 14:00 Failure rate:51%, third email triggered
> ...

Other than that, when authorized devices are used offline, their usage during that time period will be submitted when they get online the next time and this may cause exceptions (an exception is counted when active devices exceed the quota for any given 3-minute time slot). Dynamsoft allows a number of exceptions per each License Item. As time passed and activity usage increased, this number also increased. At each check point (the 10-minute mark), if the ratio of raised exceptions to total allowed exceptions reaches the following targets, an email will be triggered as well.

* 50%
* 75%
* 90%
* 100%: Too many exceptions, the License Item is deactivated.

## Questions

### Can I add multiple recipients for the email notification?

Yes. This is done differently for different hosting options.

For Self-hosting LTS, simply use a semicolon to separate different emails in the LTS management portal
