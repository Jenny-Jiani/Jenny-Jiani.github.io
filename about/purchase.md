# Purchase a License

## How to purchase

The Licenses to use Dynamsoft Products can be purchased in a few ways

### Purchase on the Dynamsoft Store

* [Purchase Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamic-web-twain/)
* [Purchase Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/store/dynamsoft-barcode-reader/)

> This option is the simplest and can provide you with a license in a matter of minutes.

### Purchase via a Purchase Order

> This usually means sending a digital copy of the order to [Dynamsoft Sales Team](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com) which will then be processed manually. This option usually takes one or several business days.

### Purchase via a Reseller

> Dynamsoft has many distributors all over the world, you can buy from the most convenient distributor. Find the full list [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Partner/Resellers.aspx).

## Check the purchased items

All purchased items are registered to the Dynamsoft account associated with your organization. You can check your purchases in the customer portal once you log in with your account.

If you already have a Dynamsoft account and you used the same email to make the purchase, you can [log in](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Login/Login) and [check the purchase orders](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/order/list).

If you don't have an existing Dynamsoft account or you used an unregistered email to make the purchase, a new Dynamsoft account will be automatically created with that email. In this case, you must first use the [Forgot Password?](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/ForgotPassword) link and use the same email to set a password before logging in.

> You can also [register](https://www.dynamsoft.com/api-common/Regist/Regist) before making a purchase.

After logging in, if you don't land on the "Licenses" page, you can get there by clicking *Customer Portal -> License -> Full License*.

At this moment, the license(s) is not yet activated. You must [activate the license]({{site.about}}activate.html) before using it.

## License Restrictions

There are two basic restrictions for each trackable license

* Time

By default, the license is good for a year once activated. You can renew it before it expires.

* Quota

<!--TODO add quota should be doable by customer-->
The license comes with a fixed quota. If the quota is used up before the license expires, or you find that the quota cannot handle application traffic, you can add additional quota by contacting the [Dynamsoft Sales Team](mailto:sales@dynamsoft.com).

### Renew a license

Renewing a license essentially means obtaining a new license with the same quota that can be used for another year. This new license will be automatically activated based on the old license. If you are using Dynamsoft-Hosting LTS, the new license will be configured to the same [Handshake Code]({{site.about}}terms.md#handshake-code) automatically, otherwise, you will need to manually configure it to the old Handshake Code.

### Add quota

Adding quota means obtaining a new license with a specified quota and configured it to the same [Handshake Code]({{site.about}}terms.md#handshake-code). This new license will be automatically activated based on the old license. If you are using Dynamsoft-Hosting LTS, the new license will be configured to the same old Handshake Code automatically, otherwise, you will need to manually configure it to the old Handshake Code.
