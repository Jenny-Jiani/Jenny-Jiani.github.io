# DWT LICENSE

## TERMS

The official [DWT License Agreement](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Products/WebTwain_license.aspx).

## QA

### When is license verified

`DWT` verifies whether there is a valid license when a [ `WebTwain` instance is created]({{site.indepth}}features/initialize.html#creating-the-webtwain-instance). Then for individual modules such as the PDF Rasterizer, or the Barcode Reader, the license is verified when you try to invoke their respective APIs.
