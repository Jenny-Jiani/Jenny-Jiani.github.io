## HOW TO GET DWT

* [Official installer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Downloads/WebTWAIN_Download.aspx)

> With this option, you get a package meant for developers to evaluate the library. When the package is installed, you get all the [resources files]({{site.about}}faqs.html#what-are-the-resources-files) as well as samples, etc. for the library. If you are evaluating the software, you also get a 30-day free trial to use the library.

* [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dwt)

> With this option, you get all the files of the [dwt package](https://github.com/dynamsoft-dwt/web-twain-package) which will help you include `DWT` in your web application both as a regular library and as a module. Samples in the package all come with a trial license but could be expired. If the license has expired, you can get a trial license on [this page](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense).

* [YARN package](https://yarnpkg.com/package/dwt)

> Similar to using NPM, you get all the files of the [dwt package](https://github.com/dynamsoft-dwt/web-twain-package) as well.

* [Official samples](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Downloads/WebTWAIN-Sample-Download.aspx)

> With this option, you can download official samples. All these samples already contain the [resources files]({{site.about}}faqs.html#what-are-the-resources-files). If a sample is hosted on the Dynamsoft website (not Github), then the sample comes with a 30-day free trial license as well. Otherwise, the trial license could be expired in which case you can get a new one on [this page](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense).

* [Github repo](https://github.com/dynamsoft-dwt)

> With this option, you get samples and other projects related to `DWT`. Some of the samples could be experiemental. These samples come with a trial license but could be expired in which case you can get a trial license on [this page](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense).
