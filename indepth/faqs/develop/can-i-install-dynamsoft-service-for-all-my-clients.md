## Can I install Dynamsoft Service for all my clients? 

Yes. In a controlled environment, `DWT` can be distributed to all clients in one go just like other similar programs. [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-install-software) is one such technology.
