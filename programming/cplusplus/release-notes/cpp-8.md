# Release Notes for C++ SDK - 8.x

## 8.1 (01/12/2021)

### New

- Added support for MSI Code (Modified Plessey).
- Added a new member `BarcodeZoneMinDistanceToImageBorders` in the `PublicRuntimeSettings` struct to set the minimum distance (in pixels) between barcode zone and image borders. previously, it is only available in the JSON template. It can be now configured by setting the struct `PublicRuntimeSettings` -> `BarcodeZoneMinDistanceToImageBorders`.
- Added exception error message to `TextResult` when license initialization fails or decoding authorization fails.

### Improved

- Improved the localization robustness for QR Code.
- Improved the localization for low quality 1D barcodes.
- Improved the deblurring performance and recognition rate for DataMatrix. 
- Improved the recognition rate for Aztec.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where Micro PDF417 may not be localized in multiple-barcode scenarios.
- Fixed a bug where the `ExpectedBarcodesCount` and `BarcodeFormat` parameters do not work in the `RegionDefinition`.

## 8.0 (11/17/2020)

### New

- Implemented the mechanism of loading libraries dynamically at runtime when [Parameter Mode Enumerations]({{ site.enumerations }}parameter-mode-enums.html) are used (except *_AUTO and *_SKIP). Use LibraryFileName and LibraryParameters to configure.
- (For IntermediateResult Advanced Module) Added support for decoding IntermediateResult. For example, users with a binarized image could use this function to skip some image preprocessing steps.
- Implemented a new licensing tracking mechanism, License 2.0, which makes it easier for users to track license usage. 
- Added a new format control parameter, BarcodeZoneMinDistanceToImageBorders, to set the minimum distance (in pixels) between the barcode zone and image borders.
- Added a new format control parameter, MinRatioOfBarcodeZoneWidthToHeight, to set the minimum ratio (width/height) of the barcode zone.
- Added a new format control parameter, BarcodeZoneBarCountRangeArray, to set the barcode zoneâ€™s range of bar count for barcode search.
- Added a new argument, SpatialIndexBlockSize, for RPM_GENERAL_RGB_CONTRAST, RPM_GENERAL_GRAY_CONTRAST and RPM_GENERAL_HSV_CONTRAST.
- Added a new parameter, DeblurModes, so users can use different deblur algorithms for different scenarios. DeblurModes has the following enum types: DirectBinarization, ThresholdBinarization, GrayEqulization, Smoothing, Morphing, DeepAnalysis and Sharpening.

### Improved

- Improved the localization speed for the ScanDirectly mode.
- Improved the localization accuracy for DataMatrix codes with a narrow quiet zone.

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash issue that could happen when conflicts occur on Linux.

### Feature Deprecated

- DeblurLevel is now deprecated. It still works in this version but could be removed in the near future. We recommend using DeblurModes instead.
