# Project Deployment and End-user Installation

## How do I upgrade the end-user installation for all end users once I upgrade my project?

By default once your application with the upgraded version has been deployed, end-users will be prompted to install the newer version of the Dynamsoft Service.

In a controlled environment Dynamic Web TWAIN can be distributed to all clients in one go just like other similar programs. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-install-software" target="_blank">Group Policy</a> is one such technology.

You can install Dynamsoft Service silently using the following commands:

- Windows

```javascript
msiexec /i "/path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.msi" /qn

```

- macOS

```javascript
// Install
sudo installer -pkg /path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.pkg -target /Applications
// Stop service
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dynamsoft.dynamsoftservicex64.plist
// Start service
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.dynamsoft.dynamsoftservicex64.plist

```

â€¢ Linux

```javascript
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.deb

// or

sudo rpm -i path/to/DynamsoftServiceSetup.rpm
```

> Note - If you are upgrading from version 14, end-users may need to uninstall the previous version manually before reinstallation.
