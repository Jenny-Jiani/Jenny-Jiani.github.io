# Manage LTS security

Dynamsoft recommends that you change the default password the first time you log in the management portal for `LTS`. Moreover, it is recommended to change the password every few months.

A few things to note

* The default password is empty
* The user name is `admin` and it can not be changed
* Currently, there isn't a way to retrieve the password should it be lost. Therefore, please keep the password secure.

## Change The Password

Click "Security" on the left menu and you will see the UI to change the password. It is quite standard, you just input the old password, type the new password twice and submit.

After the password is changed, you will need to use the new password the next time you try to log in.
