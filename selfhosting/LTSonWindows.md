# Install Dynamsoft License Tracking Server on Windows Server

## Example Environment

* CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+
* Memory: 2G
* OS: Windows Server 2016
* Disk Space
  + System: 30 GB
  + Data: 20 GB

## Installation

### Run the installer

If you do not have the installer, please contact the [Dynamsoft Support team](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com).

### Test the server

Once the server is running, you can test it via the URL [http://127.0.0.1:48080/page/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:48080/page/index.html).

> If you changed the port during installation, you should use that port instead.

If the above page shows up, then the server is installed correctly and is ready to process requests. However, the requests can not reach it because it only listens on a local IP / Port. Therefore, the next step is to configure the network environment - reverse proxy - for it with the help of `IIS`.
