# Dynamsoft-hosting license tracking

> This article is about Dynamsoft-Hosting License Tracking, if you would rather track license usage yourself using your own self-hosting License Tracking Server, please see [Self-hosting License Tracking]({{site.selfhosting}}index.html).

> If you have not purchased any Dynamsoft SDK license that requires usage tracking, please see [how to purchase a license]({{site.about}}purchase.html).

The following assumes you have purchased a trackable license and have chosen "Dynamsoft-Hosting" on the "Activate License" page in the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/fullLicense).

## Activate the License

On the "Activate License" page, set an Alias for your license or leave the default Alias and click the "Activate" button.

Once the activation is done, the next step is to [configure the license](#configure-the-license).

## Configure the License

To configure the license is to manage the Handshake Codes for the license. For more details, please see [how to manage handshake codes]({{site.common}}handshakeCodes.html).
